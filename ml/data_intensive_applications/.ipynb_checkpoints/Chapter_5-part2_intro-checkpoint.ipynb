    "  - Scalability: If read or write load grows bigger\n",
    "  - Fault tolerence: If any single machine goes down and we still need to be available\n",

    "### Scaling to higher load\n",
    " - Simplest approach is to buy a more powerful machine (called vertical scaling or scaling up)\n",
    " - This is a shared memory architecture, where all components can be treated as a single machine\n",
    " - Problem with shared memory approach: \n",
    "   - Cost grows faster than linear - machine twice the size cannot necessarily handle twice the load\n",
    "   - Fault tolerance is limited - high end machines have hot-swappable components, but its still limited to single geography\n",
    "   - Another approach is shared disk, where several machines are used but disk is shared. However, overhead of locking limit scalability"

    "### Shared-Nothing Architecture\n",
    "* Shared-nothing architectures (called horizontal scaling) have gained a lot of popularity. In this approach each machine is called a node and is independent from other nodes\n",
    "* Can potentially distribute data across geographic regions to reduce latency for users+ potentially survive loss of entire datacenter\n",
    "* Shared-nothing architectures are not always the best choice, however we will focus on them given they are more complex and more caution. The constraints and trade-offs need to be known since db will not hide them from us\n",
    "* Shared-nothing has many advantages, but also incurs additional complexity for applications and sometimes limits expressiveness of data models that we can use"

    "### Replication vs Partitioning\n",
    " * Two common ways data is distributed across nodes\n",
    "   - Replication: Keeping a copy of same data across nodes, potentially across geographies. This provides redundancy\n",
    "   - Partitioning: Splitting a big db into smaller subsets called 'partitions' that are split across nodes (also called 'sharding')\n",
    "   - Both are different mechanism, but go hand in hand (ex: a db can be split into two partitions and with two replicas per partition)"
